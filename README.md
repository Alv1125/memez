# memez
A safe reinterpretation of https://github.com/Leurak/MEMZ
Memez does not corrupt your mbr, delete files, or cause any harmful side-effects.
Works on windows.

## usage
./memez

## installation
I really do't know how MSVC works but you can use that.
Compilation by hand is also possible; `c++ -o memez memez.cpp`.

## TODO:
* Prevent users from killing memez
* Create a windows service that runs memez at a certain time/day
* BSOD after memez has finished.
